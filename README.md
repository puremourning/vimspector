# Motivation

A message from the author about the motivation for this plugin:

> Many development environments have a built-in debugger. I spend an inordinate
> amount of my time in Vim. I do all my development in Vim and I have even
> customised my workflows for building code, running tests etc.
>
> For many years I have observed myself, friends and colleagues have been
> writing `printf`, `puts`, `print`, etc.  debugging statements in all sorts of
> files simply because there is no _easy_ way to run a debugger for _whatever_
> language we happen to be developing in.
>
> I truly believe that interactive, graphical debugging environments are the
> best way to understand and reason about both unfamiliar and familiar code, and
> that the lack of ready, simple access to a debugger is a huge hidden
> productivity hole for many.
>
> Don't get me wrong, I know there are literally millions of developers out
> there that are more than competent at developing without a graphical debugger,
> but I maintain that if they had the ability to _just press a key_ and jump
> into the debugger, it would be faster and more enjoyable that just cerebral
> code comprehension.
>
> I created Vimspector because I find changing tools frustrating. `gdb` for c++,
> `pdb` for python, etc. Each has its own syntax. Each its own lexicon. Each its
> own foibles. 
>
> I designed the configuration system in such a way that the configuration can
> be committed to source control so that it _just works_ for any of your
> colleagues, friends, collaborators or complete strangers.
>
> I made remote debugging a first-class feature because that's a primary use
> case for me in my job.
>
> With Vimspector I can _just hit `<F5>`_ in all of the languages I develop in
> and debug locally or remotely using the exact same workflow, mappings and UI.
> I have integrated this with my Vim in such a way that I can hit a button and
> _run the test under the cursor in Vimspector_.  This kind of integration has
> massively improved my workflow and productivity.  It's even made the process
> of learning a new codebase... fun.
>
> \- Ben Jackson, Creator.

# Features and Usage

The plugin is a capable Vim graphical debugger for multiple languages.
It's mostly tested for c++, python and TCL, but in theory supports any
language that Visual Studio Code supports (but see caveats).

The [Vimspector website][website] has an overview of the UI, along with basic
instructions for configuration and setup.

But for now, here's a (rather old) screenshot of Vimsepctor debugging Vim:

![vimspector-vim-screenshot](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-overview.png)

## Supported debugging features

- flexible configuration syntax that can be checked in to source control
- breakpoints (function, line and exception breakpoints)
- conditional breakpoints (function, line)
- step in/out/over/up, stop, restart
- launch and attach
- remote launch, remote attach
- locals and globals display
- watch expressions
- call stack display and navigation
- variable value display hover
- interactive debug console
- launch debugee within Vim's embedded terminal
- logging/stdout display
- simple stable API for custom tooling (e.g. integrate with language server)

## Supported languages:

The following languages are used frequently by the author and are known to work
with little effort, and are supported as first-class languages.

- C, C++, etc. (languages supported by gdb or lldb)
- Python 2 and Python 3
- TCL
- Bash scripts

## Languages known to work

The following languages are used frequently by the author, but require some sort
of hackery that makes it challenging to support generally. These languages are
on a best-efforts basis:

- Java (see caveats)
- C# (c-sharp) using dotnet core
- Go (requires separate installation of [Delve][])
- Node.js (requires node <12 for installation)
- Anything running in chrome (i.e. javascript).

## Languages known not to work

- C# (c-sharp) using mono debug adapter (vimspector unable to set breakpoints)

## Other languages

Vimspector should work for any debug adapter that works in Visual Studio Code,
but there are certain limitations (see FAQ). If you're trying to get vimspector
to work with a language that's not "supported", head over to Gitter and contact
the author. It should be possible to get it going.

# Installation

There are 2 installation methods:

* Using a release tarball, or
* Manually

Release tarballs come with debug adapters for the default languages
pre-packaged. To use a release tarball:

1. Check the dependencies
2. Untar the release tarball for your OS into `$HOME/.vim/pack`:

```
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/pack
$ curl -L <url> | tar -C $HOME/.vim/pack zxvf -
```

3. Configure your project's debug profiles (create `.vimspector.json`)

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and select which gadgets are installed:

1. Check the dependencies
1. Install the plugin as a Vim package. See `:help packages`.
2. Install some 'gadgets' (debug adapters)
3. Configure your project's debug profiles (create `.vimspector.json`)

## Dependencies

Vimspector requires:

* One of:
  * Vim 8.2 compiled with Python 3.6 or later
  * Neovim 0.4.3 with Python 3.6 or later (experimental)
* One of the following operating systems:
  * Linux
  * macOS Mojave or later
  * Windows (experimental)

Why such a new vim ? Well 2 reasons:

1. Because vimspector uses a lot of new Vim features
2. Because there are Vim bugs that vimspector triggers that will frustrate you
   if you hit them.

Why is neovim experimental? Because the author doesn't use neovim regularly, and
there are no regression tests for vimspector in neovim, so it's likely to break
frequently.  Issue reports are handled on best-efforts basis, and PRs are
welcome to fix bugs. See also the next section descibing differences for neovim
vs vim.

Why Windows support experimental? Because it's effort and it's not a priority
for the author. PRs are welcome to fix bugs. Windows will not be regularly
tested.

Which Linux versions? I only test on Ubuntu 18.04 and later and RHEL 7.

## Neovim differences

neovim doesn't implement some features Vimspector relies on:

* WinBar - used for the buttons at the top of the code window and for changing
  the output window's current output.
* Prompt Buffers - used to send commands in the Console and add Watches
* Balloons - used to display the values of variables when debugging.

Workarounds are in place as follows:

* WinBar - There are [mappings](#mappings),
  [`:VimspectorShowOutput`](#program-output) and
  [`:VimspectorReset`](#closing-debugger)
* Prompt Buffers - There are [`:VimspectorEval`](#console)
  and [`:VimspectorWatch`](#watches)

There is no workaroud for the lack of balloons; you'll just have to use
`:VimspectorEval` or `:VimspectorWatch`, or switch to Vim.

## Windows differences

The following features are not implemented for Windows:

* Tailing the vimspector log in the Output Window.

## Language dependencies

The debug adapters themselves have certain runtime dependencies. They are
categorised as follows:

* `Tested` : Fully supported, Vimspector regression tests cover them
* `Supported` : Fully supported, frequently used and manually tested
* `Experimental`: Working, but not frequently used and rarely tested
* `Legacy`: No longer supported, please migrate your config

| Language         | Status       | Switch                         | Adapter             | Dependencies                    |

| Python.legacy    | Legacy       | `--force-enable-python.legacy` | vscode-python       | Node 10, Python 2.7 or Python 3 |

For other languages, you'll need some other way to install the gadget.

## Clone the plugin

There are many Vim plugin managers, and I'm not going to state a particular
preference, so if you choose to use one, you're on your own with installation
issues.

Install vimspector as a Vim package, either by cloning this repository into your
package path, like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector ~/.vim/pack/vimspector/opt/vimspector
```

2. Configure vimspector in your `.vimrc`:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
```

3. Load vimspector at runtime. This can also be added to your `.vimrc` after
   configuring vimspector:

```
packadd! vimspector
```

See support/doc/example_vimrc.vim.

## Install some gadgets

There are a couple of ways of doing this, but ***using `install_gadget.py` is
highly recommended*** where that's an option.

For supported languages, `install_gadget.py` will:

* Download the relevant debug adapter at a version that's been tested from the
  internet, either as a 'vsix' (Visusal Studio plugin), or clone from GitHub. If
  you're in a corporate environment and this is a problem, you may need to
  install the gadgets manually.
* Perform any necessary post-installation actions, such as:
  * Building any binary components
  * Ensuring scripts are executable, because the VSIX pacakges are usually
    broken in this regard.
  * Set up the `gadgetDir` symlinks for the platform.

To install the tested debug adapter for a language, run:

```
./install_gadget.py --enable-<language>
```

Or to install all supported gagtets:

```
./install_gadget.py --all
```

To install everything other than TCL (because TCL is sadly not as popular as it
should be):

```
./install_gadget.py --all --disable-tcl
```

See `--help` for more info.

## Manual gadget installation

You essentially need to get a working installation of the debug adapter, find
out how to start it, and configure that in an `adapters` entry in either your
`.vimspector.json` or in `.gadgets.json`.

The simplest way in practice is to install or start Visusal Studio Code and use
its extension manager to install the relevant extension. You can then configure
the adapter manually in the `adapters` section of your `.vimspector.json` or in
a `gadgets.json`.

PRs are always welcome to add configuration to do this to `install_gadget.py`.

### The gadget directory

Vimspector uses the following directory by default to look for a file named
`.gadgets.json`: `</path/to/vimspector>/gadgets/<os>`.

This path is exposed as the vimspector _variable_ `${gadgetDir}`. This is useful
for configuring gadget command lines.

Where os is one of:

* `macos`
* `linux`
* `windows` (though note: Windows is not supported)

The format is the same as `.vimspector.json`, but only the `adapters` key is
used:

Example:

```json
{
  "adapters": {
    "lldb-vscode": {
      "variables": {
        "LLVM": {
          "shell": "brew --prefix llvm"
        }
      },
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "pid",
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      },
      "command": [
        "${LLVM}/bin/lldb-vscode"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LLDB_LAUNCH_FLAG_LAUNCH_IN_TTY": "YES"
      },
      "name": "lldb"
    },
    "vscode-cpptools": {
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "processId",
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      },
      "command": [
        "${gadgetDir}/vscode-cpptools/debugAdapters/OpenDebugAD7"
      ],
      "name": "cppdbg"
    },
    "vscode-python": {
      "command": [
        "node",
        "${gadgetDir}/vscode-python/out/client/debugger/debugAdapter/main.js"
      ],
      "name": "vscode-python"
    }
  }
}
```

The gadget file is automatically written by `install_gadget.py`.

Vimspector will also load any fies matching:
`</path/to/vimspector>/gadgets/<os>/.gadgets.d/*.json`. These have the same
format as `.gadgets.json` but are not overwritten when running
`install_gadget.py`.

## Trying it out

If you just want to try out vimspector without changing your vim config, there
are example projects for a number of languages in `support/test`, including:

* Python (`support/test/python/simple_python`)
* Go (`support/test/go/hello_world`)
* Nodejs (`support/test/node/simple`)
* Chrome (`support/test/chrome/`)
* etc.

To test one of these out, cd to the directory and run:

```
vim -Nu /path/to/vimspector/tests/vimrc --cmd "let g:vimspector_enable_mappings='HUMAN'"
```

Then press `<F5>`.

There's also a C++ project in `tests/testdata/cpp/simple/` with a `Makefile`
which can be used to check everything is working. This is used by the regression
tests in CI so should always work, and is a good way to check if the problem is
your configuration rather than a bug.

# About

## Background

The motivation is that debugging in Vim is a pretty horrible experience,
particularly if you use multiple languages. With pyclewn no more and the
built-in termdebug plugin limited to gdb, I wanted to explore options.

While Language Server Protocol is well known, the Debug Adapter Protocol is less
well known, but achieves a similar goal: language agnostic API abstracting
debuggers from clients.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple but effective debugging
experience in Vim for multiple languages, by leveraging the debug adapters that
are being built for Visual Studio Code.

The ability to do remote debugging is a must. This is key to my workflow, so
baking it in to the debugging experience is a top bill goal for the project. So
vimspector has first-class support for executing programs remotely and attaching
to them. This support is unique to vimspector and on top of (complementary to)
any such support in actual debug adapters.

## Status

Vimspector is a work in progress, and any feedback/contributions are more
than welcome.

The backlog can be [viewed on Trello](https://trello.com/b/yvAKK0rD/vimspector).

### Experimental

The plugin is currently _experimental_. That means that any part of it
can (and probably will) change, including things like:

- breaking changes to the configuration
- keys, layout, functionatlity of the UI

However, I commit to only doing this in the most extreme cases and to annouce
such changes on Gitter well in advance. There's nothing more annoying than stuff
just breaking on you. I get that.

# Mappings

By default, vimspector does not change any of your mappings. Mappings are very
personal and so you should work out what you like and use vim's powerful mapping
features to set your own mappings. To that end, Vimspector defines the following
`<Plug>` mappings:

* `<Plug>VimspectorContinue`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStop`
* `<Plug>VimspectorRestart`
* `<Plug>VimspectorPause`
* `<Plug>VimspectorToggleBreakpoint`
* `<Plug>VimspectorToggleConditionalBreakpoint`
* `<Plug>VimspectorAddFunctionBreakpoint`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepOver`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepInto`
* `<Plug>VimspectorStepOut`

These map roughly 1-1 with the API functions below.

For example, if you want `<F5>` to start/continue debugging, add this to some
appropriate place, such as your `vimrc` (hint: run `:e $MYVIMRC`).

```viml
nmap <F5> <Plug>VimspectorContinue
```

That said, many people are familiar with particular debuggers, so the following
mappings can be enabled by setting `g:vimspector_enable_mappings` to the
specified value.

Please note: Currently there are no `<plug>` mappings. These will be added in
future to make custom mappings much easier.

## Visual Studio / VSCode

To use Visual Studio-like mappings, add the following to your `vimrc` **before
loading vimspector**:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'VISUAL_STUDIO'
```

| Key               | Function                                                  | API |
| ---               | ---                                                       | --- |
| `F5`              | When debugging, continue. Otherwise start debugging.      | `vimspector#Continue()` |
| `Shift F5`        | Stop debugging.                                           | `vimspector#Stop()` |
| `Ctrl Shift F5`   | Restart debugging with the same configuration.            | `vimspector#Restart()` |
| `F6`              | Pause debugee.                                            | `vimspector#Pause()` |
| `F9`              | Toggle line breakpoint on the current line.               | `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()` |
| `Shift F9`        | Add a function breakpoint for the expression under cursor | `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<cexpr>' )` |
| `F10`             | Step Over                                                 | `vimspector#StepOver()` |
| `F11`             | Step Into                                                 | `vimspector#StepInto()` |
| `Shift F11`       | Step out of current function scope                        | `vimspector#StepOut()` |

## Human Mode

If, like me, you only have 2 hands and 10 fingers, you probably don't like
Ctrl-Shift-F keys. Also, if you're running in a terminal, there's a real
possibility of terminfo being wrong for shifted-F-keys, particularly if your
`TERM` is `screen-256color`. If these issues (number of hands, `TERM` variables)
are unfixable, try the following mappings, by adding the following **before
loading vimspector**:

```viml
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
```

| Key          | Function                                                  | API                                                          |
| ---          | ---                                                       | ---                                                          |
| `F5`         | When debugging, continue. Otherwise start debugging.      | `vimspector#Continue()`                                      |
| `F3`         | Stop debugging.                                           | `vimspector#Stop()`                                          |
| `F4`         | Restart debugging with the same configuration.            | `vimspector#Restart()`                                       |
| `F6`         | Pause debugee.                                            | `vimspector#Pause()`                                         |
| `F9`         | Toggle line breakpoint on the current line.               | `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()`                              |
| `<leader>F9` | Toggle conditional line breakpoint on the current line.   | `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint( { trigger expr, hit count expr } )` |
| `F8`         | Add a function breakpoint for the expression under cursor | `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<cexpr>' )`              |

# Usage

## Launch and attach by PID:

* Create `vimspector.json`. See [below](#supported-languages).
* `:call vimspector#Launch()` and select a configuration.

![debug session](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-overview.png)

### Launch with options

To launch a specific debug configuration, or specify [replacement
variables][vimspector-ref-var] for the launch, you can use:

* `:call vimspector#LaunchWithSettings( dict )`

The argument is a `dict` with the following keys:

* `configuration`: (optional) Name of the debug configuration to launch
* `<anything else>`: (optional) Name of a variable to set

This allows for some intergration and automation.  For example, if you have a
configuration named `Run Test` that contains a [replacement
variable][vimspector-ref-var] named `${Test}` you could write a mapping which
ultimately executes:

```viml
vimspector#LaunchWithSettings( #{ configuration: 'Run Test'
                                \ Test: 'Name of the test' } )
```

This would start the `Run Test` configuration with `${Test}` set to `'Name of
the test'` and Vimspector would _not_ prompt the user to enter or confirm these
things.

See [this issue](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/97) for
another example where it can be used to specify the port to connect the [java
debugger](#java---partially-supported)

## Breakpoints

* Use `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint([ { 'condition': '<condition expr>' } ])`
  to set/disable/delete a line breakpoint, with optional condition.
* Use `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<name>' [, { 'condition': '<condition expr>' } ] )`
  to add a function breakpoint with optional condition.

Both of these functions take a single optional argument which is a dictionary of
options. The dictionary can have the following keys:

* `condition`: An optional expression evaluated to deterimie if the breakpoint
  should fire. Not supported by all debug adapters. For example, to break when
  `abc` is `10`, enter something like `abc == 10`, depending on the language.
* `hitCondition`: An optional expression evaluated to determine a number of
  times the breakpoint should be ignored. Should (probablty?) not be used in
  combination with `condition`. Not supported by all debug adapters. For
  example, to break on the 3rd time hitting this line, enter `3`.

In both cases, the expression is evaluated by the debugger, so should be in
whatever dialect the debugger understands when evaluating expressions.

When using the `<leader><F9>` mapping, the user is prompted to enter these
expressions in a command line (with history).

## Stepping

* Step in/out, finish, continue, pause etc. using the WinBar, or mappings.
* If you really want to, the API is `vimspector#StepInto()` etc.

![code window](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-code-window.png)

## Variables and scopes

* Current scope shows values of locals.
* Use `<CR>` to expand/collapse (+, -).
* When changing the stack frame the locals window updates.
* While paused, hover to see values

![locals window](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-locals-window.png)

## Watches

The watches window is a prompt buffer, where that's available. Enter insert mode
to add a new watch expression.

* Add watches to the variables window by entering insert mode and
  typing the expression. Commit with `<CR>`.
* Alternatively, use `:VimspectorWatch <expression>`. Tab-completion for
  expression is available in some debug adapters.
* Expand result with `<CR>`.
* Delete with `<DEL>`.

![watch window](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-watch-window.png)

## Stack Traces

* In the threads window, use `<CR>` to expand/collapse.
* Use `<CR>` on a stack frame to jump to it.

![stack trace](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-callstack-window.png)

## Program Output

* In the outputs window use the WinBar to select the output channel.
* Alternatively, use `:VimspectorShowOutput <category>`. Use command-line
  completion to see the categories.
* The debugee prints to the stdout channel.
* Other channels may be useful for debugging.

![output window](https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-output-window.png)

### Console

The console window is a prompt buffer, where that's available, and can be used
as an interactive CLI for the debug adapter. Support for this varies amongt
adapters.

* Enter insert mode to enter a command to evaluate.
* Alternatively, `:VimspectorEval <expression>`. Completion is available with
  some debug adapters.
* Commit the request with `<CR>`
* The request and subsequent result are printed.

NOTE: See also [Watches](#watches) above.

## Closing debugger

To close the debugger, use:

* `Reset` WinBar button (`set mouse=a`)
* `:VimspectorReset` when the WinBar is not available.
* `call vimspector#Reset()`

# Debug adapter configuration

For an introduction to the configuration of `.vimspector.json`, take a look at
the Getting Started section of the [Vimspector website][website].

For full explanation, including how to use variables, substitutions and how to
specify exception breakpoints, see [the docs][vimspector-ref].

The JSON configuration file allows C-style comments:

* `// comment to end of line ...`
* `/* inline comment ... */`

Current tested with the following debug adapters.

## C, C++, Rust, etc.

* C++: [vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools)


Example `.vimspector.json` (works with both `vscode-cpptools` and `lldb-vscode`.
For `lldb-vscode` replace the name of the adapter with `lldb-vscode`:

```
{
  "configurations": {
    "<name>: Launch": {
      "adapter": "vscode-cpptools",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "<path to binary>",
        "args": [ ... ],
        "cwd": "<working directory>",
        "environment": [ ... ],
        "externalConsole": true,
        "MIMode": "lldb"
      }
    },
    "<name>: Attach": {
      "adapter": "vscode-cpptools",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>: Attach",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "attach",
        "program": "<path to binary>",
        "MIMode": "lldb"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

An alternative is to to use `lldb-vscode`, which comes with llvm.  Here's how:

* Install llvm with HomeBrew: `brew install llvm`
* Create a file named
  `/path/to/vimspector/gadgets/macos/.gadgets.d/lldb-vscode.json`:

```json

{
  "adapters": {
    "lldb-vscode": {
      "variables": {
        "LLVM": {
          "shell": "brew --prefix llvm"
        }
      },
      "attach": {
        "pidProperty": "pid",
        "pidSelect": "ask"
      },
      "command": [
        "${LLVM}/bin/lldb-vscode"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LLDB_LAUNCH_FLAG_LAUNCH_IN_TTY": "YES"
      },
      "name": "lldb"
    }
  }
}
```

## Python

* Python: [debugpy][]
* Requires `install_gadget.py --enable-python`, this requires a working compiler
to build a C python extension for performance.

**Migrating from `vscode-python`**: change `"adapter": "vscode-python"` to
`"adapter": "debugpy"`.

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "<name>: Launch": {
      "adapter": "debugpy",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>: Launch",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "<working directory>",
        "python": "/path/to/python/interpreter/to/use",
        "stopOnEntry": true,
        "console": "externalTerminal",
        "debugOptions": [],
        "program": "<path to main python file>",
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

### Legacy: vscode-python

* No longer installed by default - please pass `--force-enable-python.legacy` if
  you just want to continue using your working setup.
* [vscode-python](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)
* NOTE: You must be running `node` 10. See [this issue](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/105)

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "<name>: Launch": {
      "adapter": "vscode-python",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "<name>: Launch",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "<working directory>",
        "stopOnEntry": true,
        "console": "externalTerminal",
        "debugOptions": [],
        "program": "<path to main python file>"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

## TCL

* TCL (TclProDebug)

See [my fork of TclProDebug](https://github.com/puremourning/TclProDebug) for instructions.

## Câ™¯

* C# - dotnet core

Requires `install_gadget.py --force-enable-csharp`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch - netcoredbg": {
      "adapter": "netcoredbg",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/csharp.dll",
        "args": [],
        "stopAtEntry": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* C# - mono

Requires `install_gadget.py --force-enable-csharp`.

***Known not to work.****

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch - mono": {
      "adapter": "vscode-mono-debug",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.2/csharp.dll",

        "runtimeExecutable": "mono",
        "runtimeArgs": [],
        "env": [],
        "externalConsole": false,
        "console": "integratedTerminal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Go

* Go

Requires:

* `install_gadget.py --enable-go`
* [Delve][delve-install] installed, e.g. `go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv`
* Delve to be in your PATH, or specify the `dlvToolPath` launch option

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "run": {
      "adapter": "vscode-go",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${fileDirname}",
        "mode": "debug",
        "dlvToolPath": "$HOME/go/bin/dlv"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## PHP

This uses the php-debug, see
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug

Requires:

* (optional) Xdebug helper for chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc
* `install_gadget.py --force-enable-php`
* configured php xdebug extension
```ini
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_enable=on
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
xdebug.remote_host=localhost
xdebug.remote_port=9000
```
replace `localhost` with the ip of your workstation.

lazy alternative
```ini
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.remote_enable=on
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
xdebug.remote_connect_back=true
xdebug.remote_port=9000
```

* .vimspectory.json
```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "Listen for XDebug": {
      "adapter": "vscode-php-debug",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "Listen for XDebug",
        "type": "php",
        "request": "launch",
        "port": 9000,
        "stopOnEntry": false,
        "pathMappings": {
          "/var/www/html": "${workspaceRoot}"
        }
      }
    },
    "Launch currently open script": {
      "adapter": "vscode-php-debug",
      "configuration": {
        "name": "Launch currently open script",
        "type": "php",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${file}",
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
        "port": 9000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug web application
append `XDEBUG_SESSION_START=xdebug` to your query string
```
curl "http://localhost?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=xdebug"
```
or use the previously mentioned Xdebug Helper extension (which sets a `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie)

### Debug cli application
```
export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=xdebug"
php <path to script>
```

## JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.

* Node.js

Requires:

* `install_gadget.py --force-enable-node`
* For installation, a Node.js environemt that is < node 12. I believe this is an
  incompatibility with gulp. Advice, use [nvm][] with `nvm install --lts 10; nvm
  use --lts 10; ./install_gadget.py --force-enable-node ...`
* Options described here:
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging
* Example: `support/test/node/simple`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "run": {
      "adapter": "vscode-node",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "protocol": "auto",
        "stopOnEntry": true,
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/simple.js",
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Chrome

This uses the chrome debugger, see
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome.

It allows you to debug scripts running inside chrome from within Vim.

* `./install_gadget.py --force-enable-chrome`
* Example: `support/test/chrome`

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "launch": {
      "adapter": "chrome",
      "configuration": {
        "request": "launch",
        "url": "http://localhost:1234/",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/www"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Java - partially supported

* Java Debug Server. The [java debug server][java-debug-server] runs as a
  jdt.ls plugin, rather than a standalone debug adapter. This makes a lot
  of sense if you already happen to be running the language server.
  Vimspector is not in the business of running language servers. So, rather
  than doing so, vimspector simply allows you to start the java debug server
  manually (however you might do so) and you can tell vimspector the port
  on which it is listening. See [this issue](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/3)
  for more background.

* Java - vscode-javac. This works, but is not as functional as Java Debug
  Server. Take a look at [this
  comment](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/3#issuecomment-576916076)
  for instructions.

# Customisation

There is very limited support for customistaion of the UI.

## Changing the default signs

Vimsector uses the following signs internally. If they are defined before
Vimsector uses them, they will not be replaced. So to customise the signs,
define them in your `vimrc`.

* `vimspectorBP`: A breakpoint.
* `vimspectorBPDisabled`: A disabled breakpoint
* `vimspectorPC` The program counter, i.e. current line.

For example, to use some unicode symbols, you could put this in your `vimrc`:

```viml
sign define vimspectorBP text=ðŸ”´ texthl=Normal
sign define vimspectorBPDisabled text=ðŸ”µ texthl=Normal
sign define vimspectorPC text=ðŸ”¶ texthl=SpellBad
```

# FAQ

1. Q: Does it work? A: Yeah, sort of. It's _incredibly_ buggy and unpolished.
2. Q: Does it work with _this_ language? A: Probably, but it won't
   necessarily be easy to work out what to put in the `.vimspector.json`. As you
   can see above, some of the servers aren't really editor agnostic, and require
   very-specific unique handling.
3. How do I stop it starting a new Terminal.app on macOS? See [this
   comment](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/issues/90#issuecomment-577857322)
4. Can I specify answers to the annoying questions about exception breakpoints
   in my `vimspector.json` ? Yes, see [here][vimspector-ref-exception].
